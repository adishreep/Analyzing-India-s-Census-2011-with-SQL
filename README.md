# Analyzing India's Census(2011) with SQL

Problem Statement: This project employs SQL to derive valuable insights from the 2011 Indian census, exploring factors like literacy rate, sex ratio, workforce composition, electricity/internet connectivity, and urban-rural household dynamics. The analysis aims to shed light on socio-economic trends, providing a comprehensive understanding of India's population and enabling informed policy-making, optimized resource allocation, and development strategies.

Technique Used: SQL query writing, aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, window-functions, views

Outcome: The analysis of the 2011 Indian census data using SQL revealed several significant insights. The population of India in 2011 was 1,210,854,977 (around 1.2 billion) , with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1,061, meaning that for every 1,061 males, there are approximately 1,000 females in the population. It indicates that there is a higher proportion of males compared to females in the given population.
Uttar Pradesh had the highest population, while Lakshadweep had the lowest. 
The overall literacy rate was 63%, with males at 69% and females at 56%. Kerala had the highest literacy rate, while Bihar had the lowest. 
The workforce constituted 40% of the population, with 31% women and 69% men. Only 21% of households had an LPG connection, while electricity and internet connectivity were low at 50% and 2%, respectively. Rural households accounted for 67% of the total, while urban households comprised 33%.
